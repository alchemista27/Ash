## Root Cause Analysis ##

#### Project Description ####
This project is how I build a Machine Learning model which is used for analysing the cause of certain error in a database. The model is based on Decision Tree and Random Forest. 
This is just a simple classification model that is used to classify if a certain set of data belong to certain error label.

#### Library ####
This project is using this following python library:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit Learn

#### Result ####
The performance of the model is measured as an accuracy score. The accuracy score for both model is stated below:
1. Decision Tree accuracy 0.79
2. Random Forest accuracy 0.81
